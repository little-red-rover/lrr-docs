# _binaries

This folder contains binary artifacts generated in lrr-firmware, which are used by the firmware tool.

The stub binary here is not up to date, and only included to allow local debugging.
It is written over with the most recent version during the [pages deployment action](https://github.com/little-red-rover/lrr-docs/blob/c47ad42e98806932c1cb93e0b3619bc2d0b2bffd/.github/workflows/deploy.yml#L37).
